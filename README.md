# Bioreactor_Interface

This is a flask-based website intended to serve as a remote control panel for compactRIO controlled bioreactors in the Winkler lab at the University of Washington. A bioreactor programmed with LabVIEW using a cRIO controller in winkler lab. LabVIEW's remote access and control options are limited, so a python interface was designed to work with the existing labview code to enable scientists running the reactor to remotely monitor and control their reactors. Additionally, data collection was also implemented.
